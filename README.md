I have created this repository to experiment with WebAssembly/Rust, and hopefully have learned a bit of physics.

### Algorithms 

- Leap Frog
- Velocity Verlet Integration
- Beeman
- Runge Kutta

### Pre-requisites

- Node/NPM
- WASM Pack (You can install wasm-pack from [here](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/))
- Rust (You can install rust-lang from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

To run the code, please execute the below commands in order:

```sh
yarn install
wasm-pack build
yarn start
```
